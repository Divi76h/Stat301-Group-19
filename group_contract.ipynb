    "Many data analyses start with a question or questions we are interested in. Then we find or collect data to answer the question(s). Decide with your team members a question you are interested in and how to answer using the data set.  Include a brief description of the dataset (2 or 3 sentences) and a link or reference on how to access the dataset. Note that in the next individual assignment you will be asked to fully describe the dataset. \n",

    "The dataset HR-Employee-Dataset describes the characteristics of 1470 employees. These characteristics include age, attrition, how often they travel for work, commute time, monthly income, and more. For this project, we would like to explore how various variables affect employee attrition. We can answer this by creating models using logistic regression for multiple variables.\n",
